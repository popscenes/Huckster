WHILE THE FOREGOING LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW IN THE APPLICABLE JURISDICTION, WHERE CONDITIONS, WARRANTIES OR OTHER RIGHTS ARE IMPLIED IN THIS AGREEMENT OR OTHERWISE CONFERRED BY LAW, AND IT IS NOT LAWFUL OR POSSIBLE TO EXCLUDE THEM, THEN THOSE CONDITIONS, WARRANTIES OR OTHER RIGHTS WILL (BUT ONLY TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY LAW) APPLY TO THIS AGREEMENT.
